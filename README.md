Cafeteria Order Data Analysis - Internship Challenge
Hi, I’m Khan Mohammed Arhum, and this is my submission for the internship challenge. The goal was to analyze a cafeteria dataset to find insights. I couldn’t use MySQL due to laptop issues, so I used Python scripts to explore the data and found three ideas to improve the cafeteria. This repository has all my work, including scripts, text files, and a detailed report.

For the full story, please read REPORT.pdf. It explains how I went from 64 tables to 21, my three insights, and ideas to help the cafeteria.

Files
Python Scripts:
ExtractAllTables.py: Pulls all 64 tables and their columns from Cafeteria Order Data.sql into table_definitions.txt.
IMPtables.py: Copies 36 useful tables and columns to useful_table_definitions.txt.
InsightSummary.py: Analyzes 21 tables, calculates numbers, and saves three insights to insights_summary.txt.
Text Files:
table_definitions.txt: Lists all 64 tables and columns.
useful_table_definitions.txt: Lists 36 useful tables and columns.
insights_summary.txt: Shows my analysis numbers and three insights.
Report:
REPORT.pdf: My full report with the process, insights, and ideas.
How I Did It
I started with a big SQL file but couldn’t open it in MySQL. I used VS Code and Python to:

List all 64 tables (ExtractAllTables.py).
Pick 36 useful tables (IMPtables.py).
Focus on 21 tables with lots of data and find insights (InsightSummary.py).
Check REPORT.pdf for the details and my three ideas to make the cafeteria better!
